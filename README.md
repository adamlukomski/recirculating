# Recirculating carriage

This is a fork of a linear carriage originally made by J. Rocholl, modifications:

- adjusted for a 2020 aluminium extrusion (I used a version with round corners by arma.info.pl, hopefully will work with 2020 Misumi aluminium extrusions)
- this one uses 6mm plastic balls (ammunition for airsoft guns, ABS balls)
- adjusted for printing on PP3DP Up! 2 (Afinia Up!) with ABS+
- more holes in the plate, for placing hex nuts in there (M3 by default)

Have fun! (hopefully printable straight away, if not - email me, I'll update it)
